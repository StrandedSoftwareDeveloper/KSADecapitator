Uses Harmony to patch over the renderer to make KSA headless.  
Currently very WIP (read: doesn't work yet), see recent commit messages for progress.

Uses [StarMap](https://github.com/StarMapLoader/StarMap), [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony), [.NET 10](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0), and of course [Kitten Space Agency](https://ksa.ahwoo.com/).
